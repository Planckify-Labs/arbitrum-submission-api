/**
 * Bridge capability — canonical wire types.
 *
 * Spec: docs/bridge-capability-spec.md (mobile-app repo) §5, §6, §7.
 *
 * These shapes are the contract between the provider registry (§5.2),
 * the `/bridge/*` controller, and the mobile `BridgeQuoteCard` /
 * `BridgeProgressCard`. Two rules make them load-bearing:
 *
 *  1. **Identity is CAIP-2 / CAIP-19, never a provider number.** LI.FI's
 *     private chain numbering (`1151111081099710` for Solana) lives
 *     inside the adapter and must not leak upward (§5.2). That is what
 *     kills the `0x…{40}` regex problem generically instead of adding a
 *     Solana special-case.
 *  2. **Decimals travel with the token, never as a constant.** Stellar
 *     USDC has 7 decimals; USDC everywhere else has 6 (§5.4.1, §6). A
 *     shared `USDC_DECIMALS = 6` would misprice every Stellar amount by
 *     10x, so `BridgeToken.decimals` is required and sourced from the
 *     adapter.

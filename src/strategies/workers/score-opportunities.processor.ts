 * refused, or it could not check. Every validator ends in
 * `catch { return false }` and `TargetResolverService.resolve` ends in
 * `catch { return null }`, so one flaky RPC read looks exactly like "this pool
 * is not depositable".
 *
 * That is not theoretical. Measured 2026-08-21: four Aave v3 reserves
 * (Ethereum cbBTC, Base cbBTC, Ethereum rETH, Arbitrum weETH) were persisted as
 * NULL by this worker while `pnpm defi:dry-run --protocol aave-v3` resolved all
 * four against the same chain state and the same pinned Pool addresses. Across
 * three device captures aave-v3 read 19/33, then 26/33, then 21/33 with no code
 * change touching Aave — a deterministic resolver cannot produce three answers.
 * This worker runs at concurrency 8 against one RPC proxy; the dry run does not.
 *
 * So a null NEVER overwrites a target that was validated recently. The pool is
 * retried on the next tick, and if it keeps failing for the whole grace window
 * the target does clear — bounding how long a genuinely dead target can survive
 * to one day, while the flapping disappears entirely.
 *
 * `resolvedAt` is deliberately NOT refreshed when the previous target is kept:
 * the window is measured from the last SUCCESSFUL validation, so repeated
 * failures cannot extend it indefinitely.

 * app rather than merely losing its in-app badge, which is strictly worse and
 * much harder to notice.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-21: as `api.llama.fi` lookups started timing out, the EVM
 * row count fell 169 → 141 and `sparklend` went from 5 visible pools to 1 —
 * with no change to Spark, to the scorer, or to the pools themselves.

/**
 * **Radiant was REMOVED 2026-08-21 (security sign-off, finding 2). Do not
 * re-add it.**
 *
 * Two independent reasons, either of which is disqualifying:
 *
 *  1. The address that used to sit here, `0xF4B1486DD74D07706052A33d31d7c0AAFD0659E1`,
 *     is not Radiant's lending Pool. It REVERTS on `getReservesList()` and on
 *     `getReserveData(asset)` — the exact call `validateAaveV3` makes — so the
 *     family resolved nothing. Radiant's own docs name a different pool
 *     (`0xE23B4AE3624fB6f7cDEF29bC8EAD912f1Ede6886`, 15 reserves, unpaused).
 *     The pinned value matched only a block-explorer label, which
 *     ./README.md rule 1 forbids as a source.
 *  2. **Radiant is winding down.** After a ~$50M exploit in October 2024
 *     (attributed to a DPRK-linked group), its DAO announced a wind-down on
 *     2026-06-01: maintenance mode, no further development, borrow caps to
 *     zero, TVL down from >$300M to ~$2.2M, front-end committed only through
 *     end of 2026.
 *
 * Reason 2 is why this is a deletion rather than an address fix. Correcting
 * the constant would have taken a family that resolved nothing and made it
 * resolve into a protocol that is shutting down — the failure mode a
 * diff-only review walks straight into.

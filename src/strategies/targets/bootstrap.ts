/**
 * Resolver bootstrap (pool-level spec §5.1, expansion spec §8.6).
 *
 * Registration order is load-bearing in one place only: §12 Q3 wants a
 * protocol's ERC-4626 wrapper tried before its raw cToken, so `venus-4626`
 * registers ahead of `venus`. Everything else is order-independent — the
 * registry routes by `family`/`aliases`, never by position.
 *
 * Adding a protocol is one `registerResolver(...)` here plus its one-file
 * resolver. No branch anywhere.
 *
 * **Tier flags default OFF** (see feature-flags.ts): a family goes live only
 * once its Layer-1 validator, Layer-4 decode assertion and Layer-5 pause check
 * are fork-tested (§11.3) and its pinned addresses have security sign-off
 * (§12 Q7). The flags gate BOTH sides — the mobile adapter registration is
 * gated by the twin flags in `mobile-app/constants/configs/featureFlags.ts`, so
 * a half-wired family never badges "Deposit in-app".

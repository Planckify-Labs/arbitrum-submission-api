/**
 * The protocol catalogue — one entry per protocol (runbook §11.2, §11.5c).
 *
 * **This is the file an engineer adds a protocol to.** Everything a protocol
 * needs is here: how it executes, where its address comes from, which chains it
 * is on, and its tier. Registration, feature-flag gating and the kill-switch
 * are derived from the entry, so a protocol cannot ship half-wired.
 *
 * ## The recipe
 *
 * 1. Find the protocol's own address source. `DefiLlama/yield-server`'s
 *    `src/adaptors/<slug>/index.js` names the endpoint and the field the
 *    address lives in — read it as documentation, not as code to copy (that
 *    repo ships no LICENSE; verified 2026-08-19).
 * 2. Cross-check the endpoint against the protocol's OWN docs. Adding it here
 *    means treating that domain as authoritative for where user funds go.
 * 3. Add one `registerProtocol({...})` below.
 * 4. `pnpm defi:dry-run --protocol <slug>` — resolved counts, and a named
 *    reason for every refusal.
 *
 * ## What you do NOT have to remember
 *
 * The safety layers are not opt-in. A resolver that cannot be confident returns
 * `null` → Manual; `validateTarget` has no `default: true` for EVM kinds, so a
 * kind without a validator is rejected rather than trusted; the deposit-time
 * pipeline runs regardless. The worst outcome of a wrong entry here is a pool
 * that stays Manual, never funds sent somewhere they should not go.

// ── Pinned-vault protocols: one vault per asset, so nothing to discover ────

/**
 * Avant Protocol — `savBTC` / `savUSD` / `savETH`. Pinned, correct, and STILL
 * withheld. The reason is worth reading before anyone tries again.
 *
 * The old reason ("no public vault-list endpoint found") was wrong twice over:
 * there is nothing to enumerate — one staked vault per asset, named as a
 * constant in Avant's own adaptors — and the addresses verify cleanly on chain.
 * They are pinned in `address-book/vaults.ts` and they stay pinned, the same
 * way ORIGIN_VAULTS keeps correct contracts that have no usable pool.
 *
 * **What actually blocks it is the exit, and only a fork run found it.** savETH
 * follows Ethena's `StakedUSDeV2` pattern: while `cooldownDuration != 0` (it is
 * 86400), `withdraw`/`redeem` REVERT with `OperationNotAllowed()`
 * (0xf50a3b52), and the only exit is `cooldownShares()` -> wait -> `unstake()`.
 * Proven on a mainnet fork at block 25,803,000 — the deposit succeeded and the
 * MAX withdraw reverted (`__fork__/onboarding.fork.test.ts`).
 *
 * Every earlier check said yes: `asset()`, `totalAssets()`, `convertToShares()`
 * and `maxDeposit()` all answer, and because `cooldownDuration()` is READABLE
 * the exit-terms probe reports an honest `delayed`. An honest label on a button
 * that always reverts is still a broken button, which is why §11.2 asks for a
 * round trip rather than a deposit.
 *
 * Unlocking it needs a cooldown-aware exit, not a discovery or address fix.
 * `services/defi/adapters/ethena.ts` is the shape — the same two-step already
 * exists there for sUSDe.

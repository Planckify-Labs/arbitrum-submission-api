/**
 * Candidate-address sources — how a resolver gets "the contract this pool is
 * probably about" (spec §4, §12 Q1).
 *
 * A DeFiLlama `/pools` id is an opaque UUID, so turning a pool row into an
 * on-chain address needs a *candidate* from somewhere, which the resolver's
 * validator then proves or rejects. For a long time there was exactly one
 * somewhere: DeFiLlama's `/poolsOld` feed. Then DeFiLlama put it behind a paid
 * plan and **seven resolver families stopped resolving anything**, with no
 * error, because a missing candidate is indistinguishable from "this pool is
 * not ours".
 *
 * One external endpoint should never have been able to do that. So candidates
 * now come from a registry of sources, tried in order:
 *
 *   1. **Protocol-specific sources** — the protocol's OWN on-chain registry
 *      (Euler's `GenericFactory` proxy list, Fluid's `getAllFTokens`, Curve's
 *      MetaRegistry, a Solidly factory's `getPool`). These are strictly better
 *      than an aggregator: nobody can paywall them, they cannot go stale, and
 *      reading them is the same trust model as the validator that follows.
 *   2. **The generic fallback** — `/poolsOld`, when it is reachable.
 *
 * Adding a protocol is one `registerCandidateSource(...)`. No branch anywhere,
 * same docking rule as the resolver registry itself.
 *
 * A candidate is never an authority. Every caller still runs its kind's
 * validator, and a wrong candidate fails closed to Manual rather than routing
 * funds (§8.2). What a source must never do is *invent* an address: returning
 * null is always correct, guessing never is.
